### v3.1-U_Net-EarlyStopping-lambda100_1

**Version Description:** "In `v1.2-U_Net-EarlyStopping`, the generator's loss function hyperparameter was changed to 100:1. Test results show higher SSIM and PSNR compared to the 10:1 in the same version, but lower than 999:1 on `v3.0-U_Net-EarlyStopping-lambda999_1` version.

### 2.2-U_Net-EarlyStopping-Train_Disc_then_Gen

**Version Description:** Adjusted the training step logic on the basis of `v1.2-U_Net-EarlyStopping` version. First, train the discriminator until convergence, then the generator until convergence. This convergence criterion uses the Early Stopping method, switching training based on no further updates in discriminator or generator loss on test data over 25 epochs. The overall training ends if the first epoch after switching to generator training doesn't produce better generator loss over 25 consecutive epochs. Based on the test results, the performance is not as good as the v1.2-U_Net-EarlyStopping version where the generator and discriminator are trained alternately.

### v2.0-U_Net-EarlyStopping-genOnly

**Version Description:** Removed discriminator from version `v1.2-U_Net-EarlyStopping`, train only the generator. Compared to the `v1.2-U_Net-EarlyStopping` version with alternate generator and discriminator training, the new generator training shows slightly better Loss, SSIM, and PSNR values. However, the visual quality of its predicted images is not as good, having some flaws.

### v1.2-Bowtie-EarlyStopping

**Version Description:** Removed generator skip connections from version `v1.2-U_Net-EarlyStopping`, generator uses bowtie-like architecture. The performance obtained by bowtie-like training is far inferior to that of the U-Net structure, see `v1.2-U_Net-EarlyStopping` of the test for a comparison.

### v1.1-U_Net-EarlyStopping

**Version Description:** Added early stopping to `v1.0-U_Net`: training halts if no reduction in `test generator loss` within `patience` epochs, but stops only after model save post the next `epoch_break`.

**Comparative Analysis:** Outperforms `v1.0-U_Net` in all metrics and visual quality. EarlyStopping prevents overfitting observed in `v1.0-U_Net` results. EarlyStopping training at epoch `225` instead of `300` epochs in `v1.0-U_Net`.

**Key Component Summary:** Same as `v1.0-U_Net`, except for the training method.

### v0.2-U_Net-EarlyStopping(train anomaly)

**Version Description:** Added early stopping to `v1.0-U_Net`, but with faulty logic. Post-epoch 143, generator loss surged, degrading performance. Theoretically, early stopping shouldn't affect training; cause unknown.

**Key Component Summary:** Same as `v1.0-U_Net`, except for the training method.

## README for `train_test` Code Integration

### Functionality
- **Model Saving:** After completing the 'train' function call, the `train_test` code automatically saves the trained generator model in '.h5' format.
- **Resuming Interrupted Training:** In scenarios where the code execution is interrupted, rerunning the `train_test` code will pick up the training process from where it left off. The code prints out the previous training information and continues the training until the specified number of epochs is reached and the generator model is saved.
- **Training Completion Check:** If the generator model file already exists when the code is run, it implies that the training phase has been completed previously. In this case, the code will skip the training steps and proceed directly to the testing phase.

### Instructions for Use
1. **Initial Run:** Execute the `train_test` code. The training phase will begin, processing the data and adjusting the generator model.
2. **Interrupted Sessions:** If the training is interrupted, simply rerun the `train_test` code. It will resume training from the last saved state.
3. **Testing Phase:** Once the model is trained and saved, or if a pre-trained model is detected, the code will enter the testing phase to evaluate the model's performance.
